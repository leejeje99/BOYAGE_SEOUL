Warning...a lot of construction and renovation so you won’t get to see any of the water features in previous pictures.

Bring your walking shoes, lockers are provided for free on site. This is a great place to let the kids run around.

Located in the “heart” of Seoul, there are many places close by to explore further.

Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to stumble upon the guard changing ceremony, I later found out this takes place twice a day in front of Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung at 10 am and 2 pm (except on Tuesdays). There are also photo opportunities with the guards.

Entering the palace grounds, it kind of reminds me of Joseon drama. Quite a number of visitors were spotted to be donned in Hambok, which is a recommended activity to take you back in time.

There is also a small cafe and restrooms within the vicinity.

Overall, a must-visit if it is your first time to Seoul.",February 2020,40

though its cold and raining snow but the ceremony is still on going. lots of tourists even in winter season. Palace is too big to explore so you need to give your whole day for this palace alone.",January 2020,50
Gyeongbokgung Palace,Start your visit to South Korea here!,"This is the largest palace complex in Seoul. Its history is very interesting! The palace is in reality a reconstruction; the original palace was burned and demolished by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea last century. The restoration of the palace is quite good. Unfortunately, most rooms are empty as their contents disappeared. Only the library in the back of the palace is original and its content is well-preserved. It still works as a public library. The floors, colors, roofs, and windows are original.

Some tips:

1. If you plan to stay in Seoul for at least four or five days and want to learn on the rich past of Korea, you should start you visit here.

2. You may spent the whole day visiting the palace grounds. It is quite relaxing, very well-kept, large, magical. There is a traditional, small tea shop within the palace where you can refresh drinking a delicious Korean tea in a Korean atmosphere.

3. Bathrooms are located in different places. They are impeccable.

4. Buy the ticket that covers all palaces. It is cheap. It last for several days. It will give you access to three other palaces (Two are close by), the secret garden (beautiful place), and the Jongmyo sanctuary. All are UNESCO sites. The sanctuary is far away and you need to take the metro. The palaces and the gardens are walking distance. This is why you need at least 2, (ideally 3 days) to visit all these sites.

5. If your interest is in in the rich past of Seoul ( Joseon period), the ticket is perfect. Look for a hotel in this area. Seoul is very big and crowded. Traffic is hectic and distances are enormous.

6. If you rent a Hanbok (Traditional Korean clothing) you will have free access to the palace. This is nice as it will make you feel more local and the pictures could be lovely. However, keep in mind that clothing is heavy and hot. We were there in September of 2019. It was a warm and humid day. It was not too hot. However, people wearing Hanboks shortened their visit because of how hot and wet they felt.

7. See the change of guards. We saw it at noon. It is a colorful symbolic, short ceremony. No many tourists; people behaved really well.

8. After finishing your visit, go to Insa Dong for dinner and shopping. It is really nice and relaxing. It takes 10-15 minutes to get to Insa Dong (walking distance). You may have ice cream midway.",September 2019,50
Gyeongbokgung Palace,Excellent!,"Its like stepping into a movie and reliving South Korean Joseon Dynasty again. This was so sensational. It is spectacular how this is divided from the modern world. If I were to go back to South Korea, I would visit more of the ''tradional'' places and visit this one again.

Not only can you relive this, but the art performances were also magnifying. I felt like a South Korean royal, watching the entertainers. I am looking for a song one of the Pansori singers sang but still am not able to find it after so many years",May 2019,50
Gyeongbokgung Palace,Travel back in time,"A visit to the palace is not complete without wearing the colorful Hanbok, Korea's national costume.

It will definitely make you appreciate the palace and the country more.",November 2019,50

Namdaemun market,Markets rock!,"My husband, son and I visited Seoul, South Korea for the very first time the end of January. Our Hotel, the Tmark Grand Hotel, was within walking distance of the Namdaemun Market and we visited it numerous times over the course of the week we were there.

I'm not a big shopper but I am a foodie and we ate in a couple of restaurants in the Market as well as sampling some of the street foods and I also purchased some Honey Butter Almonds, which are a very popular foodie souvenir to buy when in South Korea, at a lower price than if you go to an actual shop that specializes in them (of which there are MANY). :)

I love Night Markets. Coming from Canada I can't get enough of them when I visit Asia. Everything looks so FOREIGN! LOL! I saw all manner of fresh fruits for sale, spices, clothing, foodie treats, and much, much more.

The Market, which is the largest traditional Market in South Korea, has over 10,000 vendors, retailers and wholesalers. It is a dense maze of stalls and restaurants. One night while we were looking for a spot to get some dinner we came out of a back alley to be faced with a stunning Old City Gate right across the street which turned out to be Sungnyemun Gate, South Korea's #1 National Treasure. You honestly never know what is going to be around the next corner.

Merchants have been selling items near this location since 1414 AD!!!!! There is an information booth with people in it that do speak some English which is super helpful. They also have free maps so you can orient yourself. We went to the Information booth one evening for a restaurant recommendation and were pleased.

Just go wander.....it's uber fun!",January 2020,40
Namdaemun market,The ONLY Market Worthy of Attention in Seoul.,"Dear colleague travelers, here I leave you a review for the one and only market worthy of a visit in Seoul: The Namdaemun Market. Filled with excitement, strange and curious things, lots of interesting street food, raw food ingredients, music, clothing, souvenirs and its booming with people.

Still the rule of South Koreans is not to understand a word of English; but in this market like everywhere in South Korea; be ready for price rise as soon as they see you coming and being a non-Korean. Speculation is in the air.

Most of the things you'll be able to buy when it comes to clothing and souvenirs; is cheap worthless Chinese crap. But concentrate on the raw products and on the street food. At least prices are exposed and the prices are the same for foreigners and locals alike.

Just walk around (watch your pockets) as there are some suspicious persons in the area. Don't spend much (you will be tempted) but remember most of the souvenirs globally are cheap Chinese products that you'll end up throwing away.

In Korea you need to concentrate on walking a lot as there is plenty to walk, take fresh air, don't spend on garbage, have some curious food and the points of Interest are to be museums, palaces and all related to this activities. (museums and monuments, places, etc are really cheap). This is my advise.

We recommend this market as the ONLY one worth. The rest is just copy and paste.",January 2020,50

seoul city wall trail,Where History Meets the Modern City,"Wherever you look there is a hidden piece of history. In the heart of Seoul you can find Hanyang Doseong, a 600-year-old fortress that once protected the powerful Hanyang, Seoul’s name during the Joseon dynasty. Comprising 18.6 km, the fortress extends across the four main mountains in Seoul: Bugaksan Mountain, Naktasan Mountain, Namsan Mountain and Inwangsan Mountain Currently 12km of length are displayed as a touristic site.

Hanyang Doseong was built under the order of the first king of the Joseon dynasty, Taejo of Joseon. The wall worked as fortress to protect his palace and the new established capital in Seoul. Many walls have been taken down since then; mainly because of the modernization of the city, the construction of the subway lines or because of the negligence of the governors during the Japanese Colonization. Thankfully, in 2012, Seoul Metropolitan Government established a department exclusively responsible for the wall, Hanyangdoseong Division, which manages the restoration and preservation of this historic landmark.
Whether you enjoy hiking trails, sightseeing, learning about history or you just simply want to wander around nature and let your thoughts flow, Hanyang Doseong is the perfect place for you! The best part about it is that there are many trails you can choose from. Depending on the historic sites you want to visit or how far you want to test your limits, the following are the courses Hanyang Doseong has been divided into.
1. Baegak Mountain Trail
Trail: Changuimun Gate – Hyehwamun Gate
Distance: 4.7km

You can find this and more information in the official website for Hanyang Doseong!

You should as well check out the different historic sites you can find while strolling around every trail. As I hiked the Naksan Mounain Trail, I was able to see the Hyehwamun Gate, the Naksan Park, the Jangsu Village and the Heunginjimun Gate. Depending on the course you follow, you could either get to the famous Namsan Tower or Namdaemun Market.

I had the opportunity to visit this historic site thanks to Funday Korea Networks, a platform that brings foreigners together to promote Korea’s historic heritage, food and festivals. If you are a foreigner living in Korea or you’re a traveler passing by, I totally recommend visiting their website and participating in their events. You will live a unique experience and meet new friends!

As you can see in my pictures, visiting Hanyang Doseong along with friends is a really fun idea! Even if you happen to stumble upon a cloudy Seoul as I did, you can have lots of fun learning about history, enjoying the remains of an ancient location without leaving the city.

Once you reach the Heunginjinmun Gate, which means you finished the Naksan Mounain Trail, you can easily find the famous shopping center Dongdaemun Market. Once there, some of the nearby landmarks of Seoul you can find are: the Cheonggyecheon Stream, the Pyounghwa Fashion Plaza and . This fusion between the past and the present is right where history meets the modern city!

For visiting Naksan Mounain Trail you can take the subway up to Hansung Universty Station Exit 4 or Hyehwa Station Exit 1. The course ends in near Dongdaemun Station Exit 10, where you can take the subway to go home or to continue your next adventure in Seoul!",July 2020,50
seoul city wall trail,A historic and cultural must-see,"Hanyang Doseong, Seoul City Wall, was built over 600 years ago. The historic wall can reach up to 8 meters high and winds around (within) north Seoul for 18.6 kilometers. Over seventy percent of the wall is originally preserved, and bears witness to four centuries of Korean history. I learned about the rich history of what the wall meant to the people of Korea from reading our booklet. In the past, anyone that died had to be buried outside of the wall.... for the wall was considered to be a sort of circle containing life. People journeying to Seoul could see the wall as a landmark and many scholars would venture along the whole length of the wall. The wall has six unique trails to venture along, each with unique, breathtaking views of Seoul city from different angles. I would recommend taking all six trails to feel the deep history of the wall and do take in new views of Seoul. You can also enjoy beautiful artwork and sculptures on your way down the trail. You can travel alone to embark on a thoughtful journey or with friends to enjoy a refreshing excursion among the wall. Either way you can join a cultural and historic journey and also enjoy seeing the modern bird’s-eye views of Seoul.. It’s a must-see... visit Hanyang Doseong, where you can feel the heartbeat of historic and modern Korea.",July 2020,50
seoul city wall trail,2 day hike around the walls and sights,"We started in the east, walked south the Namsan and then finished for the day in the west. Top of Nanshan was about 1/2 way and perfect for a break and coffee at top (plenty of choices of cafes). The southern section is the most tricky to follow as little of the wall remains and signs are few in places. Approx. 9km.
Day 2 we picked up where we left off, heading north and getting a peak done and then coffee in the valley then up the main hill. Nice cafes in the final 2 km.
Suitable for kids who can walk well and those that enjoy stairs! Fine for folks who are worried about heights - no nerve-wreaking sections here. Some exposed sections so hat needed and take care in wind.",May 2020,40
seoul city wall trail,Only 12 miles but it's hard,The city wall walk is only 18km about 12 miles but there is a lot of us and downs. Not very easy to follow in places so the information sheet is very useful to keep you on the right trek.,March 2020,50

seoul city wall trail,it's a toss up,"because of the obsessively stubborn cultural korean way, you may regret going in this 'excursion' if having small children; once you start your walk on the perimeter, they won't let you out & also even check your passport at some point when going by the blue house (the korean white house)..",April 2019,30
seoul city wall trail,really good,Did a fair bit of the walk and found it really good and as you walk higher up you get great views. You will find nice little cafes and viewing points for great photos.,October 2019,50
seoul city wall trail,Nice to explore around,"Take the subway to Dongdaemun station and you will see the Southern Gate and the wall. It is part of the wall that surrounds the whole ancient city around Seoul. There are local stores and roadside peddlers selling local food and products. Stop by and try their local odeng (fishcake in clear soup), topokki (rice cakes in slightly spicy gravy), local sausages, which seems to be available everywhere. Nearby you can see the the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (like a structure from a Star Trek movie) and various shopping malls including duty free malls (without the tobacco and liquor).",November 2019,40

seoul city wall trail,A Highlight!,There are many sections of the city wall to follow. I chose the portion leading up Mt. Namsan to the N.Seoul Tower in Namsan Park. It was a section of about 500m beyond the cable car station and traversed a beautiful idyllic forest with the momiji autumn leaf colour change. An altogether peaceful setting. Viewing platforms allow better views of the city sections and former defenses.,November 2019,50

For the best experience go up before the sun sets and watch the lights of the city come on from up there.,November 2019,50
seoul city wall trail,Great outing!,"We spent a day walking one section of the Seoul City Wall. Public transport to the Changuimum Gate was easy and straightforward and there were a couple of sweet little cafes near the gate, so we stopped for lunch and coffee. Once we started walking, it was up, up, up to a point with lovely views of the city. The only downside of this section was that it abuts a military base so photography was prohibited. Overall, though, it was a sweet way to spend a few hours, taking in the sights and the beautiful autumn leaves!",October 2019,50
Dongdaemon Design Plaza(DDP),"Lights, ready and action!","I spent an hour and half walking and admiring, in the night, this structure that was designed by late Zaha Hadid, an Iraqi-born British world-renowned architect. It has certainly inspired me on the “Dream, Design and Play” (DDP) concept behind the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP).

Getting there: Take Subway Line 2, 4, 5 to get to Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station and then take exit 1, which is connected to the DDP. Once you walk out the exit of subway station, the DDP just on the left. Climb the lighted stairs to reach the street level for appreciation of DDP.

The attraction:
If you are at the DDP during the day, I would recommend a walk around the DDP to appreciate of the unique architecture of the structure – it is built on curves and I did not see any sharp corner and long straight walls! It is mentioned that over 40,000 aluminium panels cover the DDP exterior of which none is the same. I would also recommend a walk inside the DDP - consists of a sky lounge, rest area, souvenir shop and 5 exhibition halls: Art Hall, Museum, Design Laboratory, Oullim Square and Dongdaemun History & Culture Park.

It is at night when the DDP really came alive! The lightings simply accentuate and dazzle the structure. Most of the yellow-white lightings even “moved” where these gradually intensified and then dimmed again. Participating in the “night life” is the Rose Garden with a total of some 25,550 LED roses.

Not only the architecture dazzled at night, the artistic talent was also on show when I saw and heard 2 different pianists playing the 2 pianos located in the open.

I walked across to the apM Place Shopping Mall and took the elevator to a high floor to get a bird’s eye view of DDP. I think you can also get a nice view from the high floor of other buildings (for example the Lotte Fitin Shopping Mall)

Overall, I enjoyed Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) in the night more than in the day. Nevertheless, this is one iconic landmark in Seoul that you would not want to miss! It is no wonder that many Korean dramas were filmed here as well, including “You Who Came from the Stars”, “Producer” and “She Was Pretty”.",November 2019,50
Dongdaemon Design Plaza(DDP),Massive design and art center,"DDP is Zaha Hadid design and definitely the icon of Dongdaemun. There are a couple of subway stations that stop directly underneath or nearby, hence easy to get to. The Plaza overall is quite large in size, with shops, exhibitions and art installations. There are leaderboards with maps in many locations hence easy to find your way around. Nearby DDP are underground shopping, night markets, Dongdaemum Gate, a couple fo hotels and plenty of shops and restaurants. Dongdaemun and DDP are must visit sights when in Seoul.",July 2020,40
Dongdaemon Design Plaza(DDP),Fascinating,Zaha Hadid’s Dongdaemun Design Park &Plaza is the highlight of my trip to South Korea.

Dongdaemon Design Plaza(DDP),The Humanistic Art of Architecture,"A short walk from the JW Marriott Dongdaemun Square Seoul leads to one of the world’s most impressive and incredible architectural designs, the free flowing futuristic structure of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (known as the DDP) where history marries the present and embraces the future.
Designed by the late internationally acclaimed Pritzker Architecture Prize recipient, visionary Zaha Hadid, Dongdaemun Design Plaza, frequented by both tourists and locals, greets all with the notable humanistic art of architecture.
It imparts a feeling of liquid, fluid metal.
Seoul, the capital city of South Korea, home to 10 million people, is a modern world mega-city, designated in the year 2010 as the “World Design Capital.” It is indeed fitting that he Dongdaemun Design Plaza so elegantly captures the beauty and energy of Seoul.

The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is home to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park, featuring the Dongdaemun Relic Area 2, an archaeological site discovered at the former baseball field of the Dongdaemun Stadium Complex, yielding knowledge about the life of Korean people during the Joseon period.
The tile-paved path believed to relate to the Japanese colonial period connects the building sites and the Well Site and Fireplace Feature depicted along the path.
The dual-languages of the signage of the site are Korean and English.
In the midst of this extraordinary mega-city of Seoul, resides peace and tranquility.

Dongdaemon Design Plaza(DDP),"A Modernistic Piece of Art, and Architecture as well as Technology.","There is very little I can tell you about this outstanding and gorgeous piece of engineering and architecture. Designed by world renowned architect, Zaha Hadid who is an Iraqi/British citizen..

The place has conveniently allocated metro entrances beneath the structure. I think 3 to be precise. Before you get to the building there is a mayor plaza and a walking street/ramp that leads you to the heart of it. The entrance is beneath the full structure.

The DDP of its name means: Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) has the meaning of 'Dream, Design and Play' as far as I was informed. The place is also famous and renowned for it has staged diverse cultural events including exhibitions, fashion shows, product launch shows, forums and conferences.

DDP's exterior features over 40,000 aluminum panels, none of which are the same. As I mentioned before the plaza is home to various exhibition spaces, design museum, sky lounge, rest area and a souvenir shop.
